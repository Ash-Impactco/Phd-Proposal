## **ABSTRACT** (300 words)

Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) is a promising carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology that accelerates natural silicate mineral dissolution to sequester atmospheric CO₂. Despite growing interest, critical uncertainties remain regarding CO₂ removal rates, durability, and measurement protocols under real-world agricultural conditions. This PhD research will conduct the **first comprehensive field assessment of ERW on volcanic islands**, using São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal) as a natural laboratory.

The central hypothesis is that application of finely ground basaltic rock to acidic volcanic soils will enhance mineral weathering rates by 5-15x relative to neutral pH systems, generating measurable alkalinity export (2-6 meq/L) in drainage water that translates to net atmospheric CO₂ removal of 0.1-0.4 tCO₂/ha/yr when accounting for upstream emissions.

The research will integrate **field experiments, geochemical modeling, and carbon accounting** to address four research questions:
1. What are the silicate mineral dissolution kinetics under acidic, high-organic-matter volcanic soil conditions?
2. Does alkalinity generated by ERW export to groundwater/ocean, or precipitate as secondary carbonates within the soil profile?
3. What is the net CO₂ removal when upstream emissions (grinding, transport) are included?
4. Can alkalinity export be measured with sufficient precision (<30% uncertainty) for carbon credit verification?

The methodology combines:
- **3-year field experiment** (11 plots, 22 ha, treatments: 0-50 t basalt/ha)
- **Monthly monitoring** of soil solution chemistry (pH, alkalinity, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, DIC)
- **Geochemical speciation modeling** (PHREEQC) and reactive transport (CrunchFlow)
- **Uncertainty quantification** via Monte Carlo analysis and geostatistics
- **Life cycle assessment** (LCA) for net carbon accounting

Expected outcomes include: (1) first quantitative field-based CO₂ removal rates for volcanic island ERW, (2) validated MRV protocol for carbon credit certification, (3) 3-4 peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals (*Environ. Sci. Technol.*, *Global Biogeochem. Cycles*), and (4) feasibility assessment for scaling ERW to 15,000 ha on São Miguel (potential: 1,500-6,000 tCO₂/yr removal).

This research will provide critical scientific evidence for ERW as a scalable CDR solution and establish São Miguel as a global reference site for volcanic island carbon removal.

## **1. BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE**

### **1.1 The Climate Crisis and Carbon Dioxide Removal**

Limiting global warming to 1.5-2°C requires both deep emissions reductions and large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) (IPCC AR6, 2021). The IPCC projects that 100-1,000 GtCO₂ of atmospheric removal will be necessary by 2100 to achieve net-zero emissions. Current CDR approaches (afforestation, direct air capture, bioenergy with CCS) face significant land-use, energy, or cost constraints.

**Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW)** offers a promising alternative: it accelerates natural silicate mineral weathering—a geological CO₂ sink that has regulated Earth's climate for billions of years—to anthropogenic timescales. By applying finely ground silicate rocks (basalt, olivine, wollastonite) to agricultural soils, ERW enhances mineral dissolution, generating alkalinity (HCO₃⁻, CO₃²⁻) that sequesters atmospheric CO₂ during weathering reactions and exports durably to the ocean (Beerling et al., 2020).

### **1.2 Enhanced Rock Weathering: Theory and Uncertainty**

**Fundamental Weathering Reaction:**
```
Basalt (Ca,Mg silicates) + CO₂ + H₂O → Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺ + HCO₃⁻ + SiO₂(aq) + clays
```

**Stoichiometry:** For each mole of divalent cation released, 1 mole of CO₂ is consumed from the atmosphere and exported as bicarbonate alkalinity to the ocean.

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. **Weathering rates:** Laboratory studies show rapid dissolution (Gislason & Oelkers, 2003), but field rates are 10-100x slower due to surface passivation, low mineral:water ratios, and kinetic limitations (White & Brantley, 2003).

2. **Durability:** Does alkalinity export to the ocean (permanent sequestration), or does it precipitate as secondary carbonates (CaCO₃, MgCO₃) within the soil profile (Renforth et al., 2015)?

3. **Life cycle emissions:** Rock grinding consumes energy (40-80 kg CO₂/t basalt), potentially offsetting CO₂ removal benefits at low weathering efficiencies (Strefler et al., 2018).

4. **MRV protocols:** Current carbon credit frameworks (Puro.earth, Verra) lack standardized measurement protocols for ERW, creating barriers to commercialization.

**Recent Field Studies:**
- Kelland et al. (2020): UK sorghum trial, 1.5 t basalt/ha → 0.3-0.7 tCO₂/ha/yr removal (inferred from crop yield and soil chemistry)
- Haque et al. (2020): Ontario wollastonite trial, 8-20 t/ha → 1.0-4.0 tCO₂/ha/yr (alkalinity export)
- Amann et al. (2022): Belgium mesocosm, 100 t/ha → 3.2 tCO₂/ha/yr (soil inorganic carbon increase)

**Gap:** No studies have quantified ERW on **volcanic islands**, despite their ideal conditions (young basalts, high rainfall, acidic soils).

### **1.3 Why Volcanic Islands?**

Volcanic islands offer **optimal natural conditions** for ERW:

| **Factor** | **Volcanic Islands** | **Continental Agriculture** |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| **Rock Availability** | Local basalt quarries | Must import rock (costly) |
| **Soil pH** | 4.5-6.0 (acidic) | 6.5-7.5 (neutral) |
| **Rainfall** | 1,500-3,000 mm/yr | 600-1,200 mm/yr |
| **Weathering Rate** | 5-15x faster | Baseline |
| **Alkalinity Export** | High drainage flux | Often low |
| **Farmer Motivation** | Need Mg, lime already | Variable |

**São Miguel Island** is an ideal case study:
- **Geology:** Young (<1 Ma) basaltic volcanoes with reactive minerals (olivine, pyroxene)
- **Climate:** Subtropical oceanic (1,750 mm/yr rain, 18°C mean temp), no dry season
- **Soils:** Acidic Andisols (pH 5.2-6.0), high organic matter (6-12%), Mg-deficient
- **Agriculture:** 15,000 ha intensive dairy pasture, farmers already apply 3,000 kg lime/ha/yr
- **Infrastructure:** Multiple basalt quarries, agricultural extension network
- **Baseline Data:** Real soil analysis from 11 plots (Terra Verde Association, 2024)

**Global Replicability:** If successful, this model applies to 100+ volcanic islands (Hawaii, Canaries, Cape Verde, Fiji, etc.) with potential for 1-5 MtCO₂/yr global removal.

### **1.4 Research Novelty**

This PhD will be the **first** to:
1. Quantify ERW CO₂ removal rates on a volcanic island using direct alkalinity export measurements
2. Validate geochemical models (PHREEQC, CrunchFlow) against 3-year field data
3. Develop a robust MRV protocol for volcanic island ERW carbon credits
4. Assess environmental safety (trace metal mobilization) under tropical/subtropical conditions
5. Integrate agronomic co-benefits (Mg correction, pH buffering) into economic analysis

## **2. RESEARCH QUESTIONS & HYPOTHESES**

### **2.1 Research Questions**

**RQ1:** What are the in-situ silicate mineral dissolution rates and CO₂ uptake kinetics in acidic volcanic soils under field conditions?

**RQ2:** Does alkalinity generated by basalt weathering export to groundwater/ocean (durable sequestration), or precipitate as secondary carbonates within the soil profile?

**RQ3:** What is the net atmospheric CO₂ removal when accounting for upstream life cycle emissions (quarrying, grinding, transport)?

**RQ4:** Can alkalinity export be measured with sufficient precision and accuracy (<30% uncertainty) to support carbon credit verification?

**RQ5:** What are the environmental risks (trace metal mobilization, pH over-liming) and agronomic co-benefits (Mg correction, crop response) of ERW on São Miguel?

### **2.2 Primary Hypothesis**

**H₁:** Application of finely ground São Miguel basalt (<100 µm particle size) at rates of 2.7-50 t/ha to acidic volcanic soils (pH 5.2-6.0) will:

1. **Enhance mineral weathering rates** by 5-15x relative to neutral pH soils, driven by:
   - Proton-promoted dissolution (Lasaga, 1981)
   - Organic ligand complexation (Drever & Stillings, 1997)
   - Elevated soil pCO₂ (10-100x atmospheric)

2. **Generate measurable alkalinity export** of 2-6 meq/L in soil drainage water (60 cm depth), representing:
   - >80% of total weathering-derived alkalinity (vs. <20% as soil carbonate precipitation)
   - Calcite saturation index SI < 0 (undersaturated → export is viable)

3. **Produce net atmospheric CO₂ removal** of 0.08-0.40 tCO₂/ha/yr (95% confidence interval), calculated as:
   ```
   Net CO₂ = (Alkalinity Export / 2) - Upstream Emissions
   ```
   Where upstream emissions = 50-60 kg CO₂/t basalt applied

4. **Maintain environmental safety**, with:
   - Trace metal concentrations (Ni, Cr) < WHO drinking water limits
   - Soil pH increase <0.5 units over 3 years
   - Agronomic co-benefits: Mg deficiency correction (+0.5-1.0 cmol/kg exchangeable Mg)

### **2.3 Null Hypotheses**

**H₀₁:** Weathering rates in field conditions will be ≤2x neutral pH soils (no significant pH enhancement)

**H₀₂:** >50% of alkalinity will precipitate as secondary carbonates (SI(calcite) > 0), reducing export

**H₀₃:** Net CO₂ removal ≤ 0 tCO₂/ha/yr (upstream emissions exceed removal)

**H₀₄:** Uncertainty in CO₂ removal estimates will be >50% (insufficient for MRV)

### **2.4 Testable Predictions**

| **Variable** | **Prediction (H₁)** | **Null (H₀)** | **Measurement Method** |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Mg²⁺ release rate | 5-15x baseline | ≤2x | ICP-OES, monthly lysimeters |
| Alkalinity export | +2-6 meq/L | <1 meq/L | Gran titration, field lysimeters |
| SI(Calcite) | -2 to -0.5 | >0 | PHREEQC modeling + XRD of soil cores |
| Net CO₂ removal | 0.08-0.40 tCO₂/ha/yr | ≤0 | Alkalinity × flux - LCA emissions |
| Soil Ni mobilization | <70 µg/L | >70 µg/L | ICP-MS, quarterly groundwater |
| ΔpH (3 years) | +0.2 to +0.5 | >1.0 | pH meter, annual soil sampling |

**Purpose:** Calculate equilibrium chemistry, saturation indices, DIC speciation

**Input:** Measured soil solution composition (pH, T, Ca, Mg, DIC, etc.)

**Output:**
- Saturation indices: SI(Calcite), SI(Magnesite), SI(Dolomite), SI(Quartz)
- DIC speciation: [H₂CO₃*], [HCO₃⁻], [CO₃²⁻]
- Alkalinity partitioning
- Free metal activities (Al³⁺, Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺)

**Critical Assessment:** If SI(Calcite) > 0 → Secondary carbonate precipitation → Reduced CO₂ removal credit

#### **3.4.2 Reactive Transport Modeling (CrunchFlow)**

**Purpose:** Simulate time-dependent weathering, alkalinity generation, and export

**Setup:**
- 1D vertical soil column (0-60 cm, 6 cells × 10 cm)
- Input: Basalt dissolution kinetics (from lab experiments)
- Boundary conditions: Constant rainfall (top), free drainage (bottom)
- Run duration: 10 years (daily time steps)

**Forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) dissolution:**
$$
r = k \cdot A \cdot [H^+]^{0.5} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{Q}{K}\right)
$$

Where:
- $k$ = rate constant (mol/m²/s; from Pokrovsky & Schott, 2000)
- $A$ = reactive surface area (m²/g; from BET-N₂)
- $[H^+]$ = proton activity
- $Q/K$ = saturation state

**Parameterization:** Use literature values, adjust for São Miguel conditions (pH, T, pCO₂)

### **3.5 Carbon Accounting & Life Cycle Assessment**

#### **3.5.1 CO₂ Removal Calculation**

**Primary Method:** Alkalinity Export (Direct MRV)

$$
\text{CO}_2 \text{ removal (kg/ha/yr)} = \frac{\Delta \text{Alkalinity (meq/L)} \times \text{Drainage Flux (L/ha/yr)}}{2} \times \frac{44}{1000}
$$

Where:
- ΔAlkalinity = (Treatment - Control) alkalinity
- Drainage Flux = Precipitation - Evapotranspiration (from lysimeter volumes)
- Factor of 2: alkalinity:CO₂ stoichiometry
- 44: molecular weight of CO₂

**Secondary Method:** Soil Inorganic Carbon (SIC) Accumulation

$$
\text{CO}_2 \text{ in soil (kg/ha/yr)} = \Delta \text{SIC (kg/ha/yr)} \times \frac{44}{12}
$$

(Uncertainty: SIC may reverse over time, so NOT counted as primary removal)

#### **3.5.2 Upstream Emissions (LCA)**

**System Boundaries:** Quarry → Crushing → Transport → Application

| **Process** | **Emission Factor** | **Data Source** | **Uncertainty** |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Quarrying | 10 kg CO₂/t | Ecoinvent 3.8 | ±30% |
| Crushing/grinding | 40 kg CO₂/t | Strefler et al. 2018 | ±40% |
| Transport (20 km, diesel) | 5 kg CO₂/t | EU fuel standards | ±20% |
| **TOTAL** | **55 kg CO₂/t** | | **±35%** |

**Calculation:**
```
For 2.7 t/ha/yr: Upstream = 55 × 2.7 = 149 kg CO₂/ha/yr
For 50 t/ha: Upstream = 55 × 50 / 10 years = 275 kg CO₂/ha/yr (amortized)
```

#### **3.5.3 Net CO₂ Removal**

$$
\text{Net Removal} = \text{Gross Removal (alkalinity export)} - \text{Upstream Emissions} - \text{Avoided Emissions}
$$

**Conservative Approach:** Do NOT count avoided lime emissions (farmer co-benefit, not CDR)

### **3.6 Uncertainty Quantification**

#### **3.6.1 Sources of Uncertainty**

| **Source** | **Type** | **Magnitude** | **Quantification Method** |
|------------|----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Alkalinity measurement | Analytical | ±5% | Replicate titrations, CRM |
| Drainage flux estimate | Hydrologic | ±20% | Multiple lysimeters, water balance |
| Spatial variability | Geostatistical | ±30% | ANOVA, semivariograms |
| Temporal variability | Seasonal | ±25% | Monthly sampling, time-series analysis |
| Baseline subtraction | Control plot | ±10% | Paired t-tests |
| LCA emissions | Literature | ±35% | Monte Carlo (literature ranges) |

#### **3.6.2 Monte Carlo Simulation**

**Approach:** 10,000 random draws from probability distributions of uncertain parameters

**Software:** Python (NumPy, SciPy), R (mc2d package)

**Output:**
- Mean net CO₂ removal (tCO₂/ha/yr)
- 95% confidence interval
- Probability of net positive removal: P(Net > 0)

**Target Uncertainty:** <30% (95% CI) after Year 3 (acceptable for carbon credit certification)

## **8. CONCLUSION**

This PhD research addresses critical knowledge gaps in Enhanced Rock Weathering as a carbon dioxide removal technology. By conducting the **first comprehensive field assessment of ERW on volcanic islands**, it will provide quantitative CO₂ removal rates, validate geochemical models, and develop robust MRV protocols suitable for carbon credit certification.

São Miguel Island offers **ideal natural laboratory conditions** (young basalts, acidic soils, high rainfall) combined with **practical advantages** (farmer partnerships, existing infrastructure, baseline data). The research integrates rigorous field experiments, advanced geochemical modeling, and stakeholder engagement to deliver outcomes that are **scientifically defensible, policy-relevant, and commercially viable**.

Expected impacts include:
- **4 high-impact publications** in top-tier journals
- **Validated CO₂ removal rates** (0.08-0.40 tCO₂/ha/yr) for volcanic island ERW
- **MRV protocol** accepted by carbon credit standards (Puro.earth, Gold Standard)
- **Pathway to scale** ERW to 15,000 ha on São Miguel (1,500-6,000 tCO₂/yr)
- **Global replication model** for 100+ volcanic islands (1-5 MtCO₂/yr potential)

This research will establish São Miguel as a **global reference site for volcanic island carbon removal** and provide critical scientific evidence to inform climate policy, carbon markets, and the future of negative emissions technologies.

**I am committed to this ambitious 4-year research program and request your support to make it a reality.**
